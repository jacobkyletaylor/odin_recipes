    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pressure cooking beef stew meat with taco seasoning allows for tender 
        chunks of beef which can be used for taco bowls. It makes enough for a week 
        of prepped lunches. Garnish with salsa, sour cream, avocado, and cilantro 
        before serving.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds beef stew meat </li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup taco seasoning mix (such as Savory Spice®) </li>
        <li>¼ cup water </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt </li>
        <li>2 ½ cups water </li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) bag yellow rice (such as Vigo®) </li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can black beans, drained, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can corn kernels, drained, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and 
        select Saute function. Heat oil. Add beef and cook until browned, about 
        3 minutes per side. Add onion, taco seasoning, 1/4 cup water, and garlic 
        salt. Stir to combine.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's 
        instructions; set timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Meanwhile, bring 2 1/2 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add rice and stir for 1 minute. 
        Cover saucepan tightly. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. 
        Remove from heat and let cool completely.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Release pressure naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. 
        Let cool completely.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Divide beef and rice among 6 reusable containers. Top with equal amounts of black beans, 
        corn, and Cheddar cheese. Cover and refrigerate.</p>
